# NYC Citi Bike Analysis 

After review of datasets illustrating bike sharing data for New York City, restaurant locations for New York City and Des Moines, IA, and population data for both cities, I have discovered some key points that support my recommendation for opening a bike sharing business in Des Moines.

The key points are illustrated in the following analysis.

## Average NYC Trip Duration by Age

My first story point looks at the average NYC bikesharing trip duration by age. It can be seen that on average, the younger a person's age, the longer the trip. It can also be seen in the following spreadsheet that a greater percentage of the population in Des Moines is under the age of 18 than the population of NYC. Therefore, it is predicted that the bikesharing business will be well supported in Des Moines.

## Peak Hours for Use

My second story point shows the peak hours of use for the bikes in NYC. It can be seen that the bikes are more frequently used around breakfast and dinner times. It might be useful to illustrate the locations of McDonald's locations around both NYC and Des Moines as bikes are rented near meal times. Additionally, McDonald's is a common eating location in both cities offering a good comparison.

## NYC McDonald's Locations

My third story point shows the locations of McDonald's restaurants in NYC. It is presumed that the McDonald's locations in NYC are more densely located than Des Moines, but the comparison offers some insight.

## IA McDonald's Locations

My fourth story point shows the locations of McDonald's restaurants in Des Moines. Further analysis would be useful to determine if bike stations would be well served near restaurants in the city or attractions. As Des Moines is more spread out than NYC, further analysis would be necessary.

## Top NYC Starting Locations

My fifth story point shows the top starting locations for bike rentals in NYC. Most data points are located in tourist areas. Des Moines has many tourist attractions and would predictably be successful in these areas.

## Top NYC Ending Locations

My sixth story point illustrates the top ending locations for bike rentals in NYC. Just as with the starting locations, the data is centered around tourist areas further proving that tourism is good for bike rentals. Des Moines has many tourist attractions as illustrated on the tourism website.

# Summary

After reviewing the above data and considering the similarities and differences between NYC and Des Moines, I think that opening a ride sharing company in Des Moines would prove very successful. With the many tourist attractions spread throughout the city, biking in Des Moines seems like a preferable means of transportation.
